# Wine-Quality-Analysis
This Project first focuses on implementing Hypothesis Testing and Linear Regression in the first 2 Questions. 
Hypothesis Testing - Focuses on using t testing and confidence intervals.
Linear Regression - Fitting a simple linear regression model then using Residual Plots ensure that all the assumptions are met. After so, to improve onto the model via transformation using a Weighted Model, which is then checked over to ensure it fufills the assumptions of the mode. After which using prediction to see the yield if the temperature is fixed at 25 Degrees Celsius.
The last question is split into 2 parts:
- Firstly by producing appropriate plots and ouput to produce some qualitative and visual summary of the dataset, demonstrating the relationship between the explanatory variables and the quality.
- Secondly using the methods i have learnt from linear regression and building onto that, finding a suitable model to predict the quality of the wine using other variables. This includes the most appropriate method for selecting the best multiple regression model.
